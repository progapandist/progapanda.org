## Why?

This is part of my research for creating scalable online coding environments for programming students at [Le Wagon](https://www.lewagon.com)

## Other OSS projects

- [lewagon/wait-on-check-action](https://github.com/lewagon/wait-on-check-action), the GitHub Action that can be used to halt any workflow until required checks for a given ref pass successfully.
- [lewagon/foot_traffic](https://github.com/lewagon/foot_traffic), pure Ruby DSL for Chrome scripting based on Ferrum. No Selenium required. Works from any script. Simulate web app usage scenarios in production or locally.
- [lewagon/quay-github-actions-dispatch](https://github.com/lewagon/quay-github-actions-dispatch), a tiny web service for securely forwarding Quay build notifications to Github Action's repository_dispatch webhook. A missing link for creating powerful build flows with Quay and GHA.
